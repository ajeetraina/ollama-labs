# Welcome to Ollama Labs

We're excited to launch Ollama Labs, your comprehensive resource for everything related to running Large Language Models (LLMs) locally using Ollama.

## What is Ollama?

Ollama is an open-source tool that makes it easy to run large language models locally on your own hardware. Whether you have a high-end GPU or just a modern CPU, Ollama allows you to run powerful AI models on your own machine without needing to send your data to external APIs.

## What You'll Find Here

At Ollama Labs, we're committed to providing high-quality resources to help you make the most of Ollama:

- **Documentation**: Clear and comprehensive guides to help you install, configure, and use Ollama
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions for common tasks and use cases
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises to build practical applications
- **Model Library**: Information about supported models and their performance characteristics
- **Community Resources**: Links to community projects, extensions, and integrations

## Get Started Today

Head over to our [Documentation](/tabs/docs/) section to learn how to install Ollama and run your first model. Or check out our [Labs](/tabs/labs/) for hands-on exercises.

We're excited to have you join us on this journey of making AI more accessible and private through local model execution!
